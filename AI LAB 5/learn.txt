Notes for CLass 5 

Supervised learning
real world problems 
two types like classification and regression

classification asigns category

regression to find out relationship btw variable

unsupervised
has unlabel data to find patterm

naive bayes
is classification approch
presence of feature no effect on other features

types of navive bayes



decison treee
superviseed learning and classificartion


we start at root node till the leaf node 

sklearn works on data training on model

pandas and numpay on data operation


Gaussian, Multinominal


K Means Clustering
There is a technique used to partition data into group(varuius clusters)
k = nimber of cluster. (centorid )Common point will be selected that is equisdistant to 
each point

The two qualities of data 
Meaningfulness Cluster
USefulness

Meaningfulness Cluster 
like medical researcher, a group finds a gene expression, different
from other group in reaction to a medicine.

Usefulnss it serves interdmediate step 
like people having butter with breaad
identify commonly associcate objects
